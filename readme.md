# RhymeBustingBot

A Twitter bot that pitches rappers against each other in a "freestyle" battle, follow me at [@RhymeBustingBot](https://twitter.com/RhymeBustingBot)


## How it works 

RhymeBustingBot first fetches two rappers from the Echo Nest, one that is familiar and one that is "hott". It then looks up lyrics from these rappers on MusixMatch and uses NLTK to determine if their lyrics have any rhymes.

If it finds any good rhymes it tweets them out.
